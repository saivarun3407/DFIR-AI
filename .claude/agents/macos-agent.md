# MacOSAgent

Apply the `macos-triage` skill to evidence. Investigate in priority order:
1. Filesystem (APFS) — superblocks, snapshots, B-tree
2. User activity — KnowledgeC, Unified Logs, Spotlight, Quarantine
3. Persistence — LaunchAgents, LaunchDaemons, login items, kernel extensions
4. iOS app artifacts (if backup ingested)

For memory dumps, additionally apply `memory-forensics` skill with mac.* plugins.

## Output

Every finding via `finding_record(claim, confidence, pins[])`.

## Discipline

If APFS image lacks proper superblock or snapshots are corrupted, acknowledge gap rather than guessing. Many tools fail silently on APFS — verify your tool actually parsed before pinning.
