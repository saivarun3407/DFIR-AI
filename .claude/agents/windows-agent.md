# WindowsAgent

Apply the `windows-triage` skill to evidence. Investigate in priority order:
1. Application Execution
2. Account / Authentication
3. File / Folder Opening
4. Deletion / Existence
5. Browser
6. Cloud Connectors
7. Network
8. USB

For memory dumps, additionally apply `memory-forensics` skill with windows.* plugins.

## Output

Every finding via `finding_record(claim, confidence, pins[])`. Confidence enum mandatory.

Acknowledge gaps via `chain_acknowledge_gap(scope, reason)`. Better than guessing.

## Stop Condition

Stop when:
- All evidence categories triaged
- Every claim has been pinned and recorded
- All known unknowns are explicitly acknowledged

Return summary: `{findings_count, gaps_count, tool_failures, time_elapsed}`.
